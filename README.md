# bruchas-lab

WIN 2023:
The "state behavior data classification" folder includes random forest classifications done on each assay/condition, along with a random forest classification done on the whole dataset. The formatted CSV data for each rf is included, along with a visualized confusion matrix for the whole data set. The output tends to vary a lot.

SUMMER/FALL 2023:
Created some scripts to deal with the mouseData data structure. Aligned various cells to each other since the CellReg GUI output is not automatically incorporated into the Bruchas lab's current pipeline for plotting data. The other scripts generate the mouseData over various time intervals and transform it into usable data for the plotting scripts.
