The "state behavior data classification" folder includes random forest classifications done on each assay/condition, along with a random forest classification done on the whole dataset. The formatted CSV data for each rf is included, along with a visualized confusion matrix for the whole data set. Right now, the biggest issue is that the classifier seems to be confusing control and isolation groups with each other more than it should be.
